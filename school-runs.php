                We offer minicabs for school runs so that your kids can get at school on time and in good condition. Our drivers are subject to Transport for London regulation and Public Carriage Office licensing. You may feel secure knowing that you and your kids are in good hands because a CRB (Criminal Records Bureau) check is included as part of the application. Our drivers are kind, amiable, accommodating, and well-mannered.

                <p>
                    For added protection and comfort, you can reserve a regular minicab with us for school pick-up and drop-off. The driver will often be the same. We recognize how crucial it is to arrive on time for school, especially when kids are involved. Numerous schools, including Kingsbury High School, Roe Green School, Oliver Goldsmith School, Fryent Primary School, Claremont High School, Canons High School, Harrow High School, Nower Hill High School, Park High School, Whitmore High School, Rooks Heath High School, and Bentley Wood High School are among those to which we transport hundreds of passengers. You can trust that we will transport your children to their destination because we have a lot of expertise in the school run taxi business and understand the significance of keeping youngsters safe.
